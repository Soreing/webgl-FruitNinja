The game engine is capable of:
- Rendering objects on the screen
- Reading textures and applying it on objects
- Creating scenes with object parent-child hierarchies
- Applying scripts on objects to specify their behaviour
- Update loop to update objects and their scripts
- Interaction with the objects using the mouse or touch
- Basic physics implementation with gravity
